# SE-Assignment-6
 Assignment: Introduction to Python
Instructions:
Answer the following questions based on your understanding of Python programming. Provide detailed explanations and examples where appropriate.

 Questions:

1. Python Basics:
   - What is Python, and what are some of its key features that make it popular among developers? Provide examples of use cases where Python is particularly effective.
   Answer:
   Python is a versatile, high-level programming language known for its simplicity and readability. Its clean syntax makes it easy to learn and use, even for beginners. Some key features that make Python popular include:

Readability and Simplicity: Python's syntax is designed to be intuitive and straightforward, making it easier to write and maintain code.
Interpreted Language: Python runs directly from the source code, which means you don’t need to compile your programs before executing them.
Dynamic Typing: You don’t have to declare the type of variable; Python figures it out at runtime.
Extensive Standard Library: Python comes with a vast standard library that provides tools suited to many tasks.
Large Community and Ecosystem: A vibrant community means plenty of resources, libraries, and frameworks are available for use.

Use Cases:
Web Development: Frameworks like Django and Flask make it easy to build web applications.
Data Science and Machine Learning: Libraries like Pandas, NumPy, and scikit-learn are extensively used for data manipulation and machine learning tasks.
Automation and Scripting: Automate repetitive tasks or perform simple scripting tasks.
Game Development: Libraries such as Pygame can be used for developing games.
Desktop Applications: Tkinter and PyQt are commonly used for developing desktop applications.

2. Installing Python:
   - Describe the steps to install Python on your operating system (Windows, macOS, or Linux). Include how to verify the installation and set up a virtual environment.
Answer:
-Installing Python on Windows:
Download Python:

Go to the Python official website.
Download the latest version of Python for Windows.
Run the Installer:

Open the downloaded installer.
Check the box that says "Add Python to PATH" (this makes it easier to run Python from the command line).
Click on "Install Now".
Verify Installation:

Open Command Prompt.
Type python --version and press Enter. You should see the version of Python you installed.
-Setting Up a Virtual Environment:

Open Command Prompt.
Navigate to your project directory using cd path\to\your\project.
Create a virtual environment by typing python -m venv venv.
Activate the virtual environment:
On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
You should see (venv) at the beginning of your command prompt line, indicating the virtual environment is active.

3. Python Syntax and Semantics:
   - Write a simple Python program that prints "Hello, World!" to the console. Explain the basic syntax elements used in the program.

   Answer:
   print("Hello, World!")

Explanation:
print: This is a built-in function in Python used to display output.
"Hello, World!": This is a string, a sequence of characters enclosed in quotes.
This program simply uses the print function to output the string "Hello, World!" to the console.

4. Data Types and Variables:
   - List and describe the basic data types in Python. Write a short script that demonstrates how to create and use variables of different data types.

   Answer:
   -Basic Data Types:
int: Integer numbers, like 42.
float: Floating-point numbers, like 3.14.
str: String of characters, like "Hello".
bool: Boolean values, True or False.
list: Ordered collection of items, like [1, 2, 3].
tuple: Immutable ordered collection, like (1, 2, 3).
dict: Key-value pairs, like {"key": "value"}.
set: Unordered collection of unique items, like {1, 2, 3}.
python
Copy code
# Creating and using variables of different data types
x = 42                # int
pi = 3.14             # float
name = "Alice"        # str
is_active = True      # bool
numbers = [1, 2, 3]   # list
coordinates = (4, 5)  # tuple
person = {"name": "Bob", "age": 30}  # dict
unique_numbers = {1, 2, 3}  # set

# Print variables
print(x)
print(pi)
print(name)
print(is_active)
print(numbers)
print(coordinates)
print(person)
print(unique_numbers)

5. Control Structures:
   - Explain the use of conditional statements and loops in Python. Provide examples of an `if-else` statement and a `for` loop.
 
 Answer:
 Conditional Statements:
Conditional statements allow you to execute certain pieces of code based on whether a condition is true or false.


age = 18
if age >= 18:
    print("You are an adult.")
else:
    print("You are a minor.")
Loops:
Loops let you execute a block of code multiple times.

# For loop example
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
for num in numbers:
    print(num)

6. Functions in Python:
   - What are functions in Python, and why are they useful? Write a Python function that takes two arguments and returns their sum. Include an example of how to call this function.

   Answer:
   - Functions:
Functions are reusable blocks of code that perform a specific task. They help organize code, reduce repetition, and improve readability.

def add_numbers(a, b):
    return a + b

# Example of calling the function
result = add_numbers(3, 5)
print(result)
   

7. Lists and Dictionaries:
   - Describe the differences between lists and dictionaries in Python. Write a script that creates a list of numbers and a dictionary with some key-value pairs, then demonstrates basic operations on both.
   Answer:
   Differences:
Lists: Ordered collections of items, accessed by index.
Dictionaries: Unordered collections of key-value pairs, accessed by keys.

# List example
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
print(numbers[2])  # Accessing the third element

# Dictionary example
person = {"name": "Alice", "age": 30}
print(person["name"])  # Accessing value by key

# Modifying list and dictionary
numbers.append(6)
person["age"] = 31

print(numbers)
print(person)


8. Exception Handling:
   - What is exception handling in Python? Provide an example of how to use `try`, `except`, and `finally` blocks to handle errors in a Python script.
   Answer:
   - Exception Handling:
Exception handling allows you to manage errors gracefully without crashing the program.
Example,
try:
    result = 10 / 0
except ZeroDivisionError:
    print("Cannot divide by zero!")
finally:
    print("Execution completed.")

9. Modules and Packages:
   - Explain the concepts of modules and packages in Python. How can you import and use a module in your script? Provide an example using the `math` module.

Answer:
- Modules and Packages:
Modules: Single files containing Python code, which can be imported and used in other scripts.
Packages: Collections of modules organized in directories.
Example with math module:

import math

# Using functions from the math module
print(math.sqrt(16))  # Output: 4.0
print(math.pi)        # Output: 3.141592653589793
10. File I/O:
    - How do you read from and write to files in Python? Write a script that reads the content of a file and prints it to the console, and another script that writes a list of strings to a file.

Answer:
Reading from a file:

with open('example.txt', 'r') as file:
    content = file.read()
    print(content)
    
Writing to a file:

lines = ["Line 1", "Line 2", "Line 3"]

with open('output.txt', 'w') as file:
    for line in lines:
        file.write(line + '\n')


# Submission Guidelines:
- Your answers should be well-structured, concise, and to the point.
